## Configure Your AI Tools

Generate configuration files that connect AI assistants to your development environment.

### MCP Config (`.vscode/mcp.json`)

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers give AI tools access to external data sources — databases, APIs, documentation, and more. Primer detects what's relevant to your stack and generates a starter config.

### VS Code Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)

Recommended editor settings for AI-assisted development, tuned to your project's languages and frameworks.

### Safe by default

Primer won't overwrite existing files. If a config already exists, you'll be asked whether to overwrite it.
