## How AI-Ready Is Your Repo?

Primer evaluates your repository across **9 pillars** organized into two groups:

### Repo Health

- **Style & Validation** — linters, formatters, editor configs
- **Build System** — build scripts, CI/CD pipelines
- **Testing** — test frameworks, coverage, test scripts
- **Documentation** — README, CONTRIBUTING, architecture docs
- **Dev Environment** — devcontainers, setup scripts
- **Code Quality** — type checking, static analysis
- **Observability** — logging, monitoring, error tracking
- **Security & Governance** — CODEOWNERS, security policies

### AI Setup

- **AI Tooling** — custom instructions, MCP servers, agents, skills

### Maturity levels

| Level | Name         | Meaning                        |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1     | Functional   | Basic tooling in place         |
| 2     | Documented   | README and instructions exist  |
| 3     | Standardized | CI/CD, policies, CODEOWNERS    |
| 4     | Optimized    | MCP, agents, skills configured |
| 5     | Autonomous   | Full AI-native development     |

Results appear as a **visual HTML report** and in the **Readiness** sidebar with drill-down into each criterion.
