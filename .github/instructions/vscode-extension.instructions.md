# VS Code Extension Development

The extension lives in `vscode-extension/` and surfaces Primer CLI commands in VS Code.

## Build

```sh
cd vscode-extension
node esbuild.mjs         # CJS bundle → out/extension.js
node esbuild.mjs --watch  # watch mode
npx tsc --noEmit          # typecheck
```

Output is CommonJS (not ESM like the CLI). Bundled with esbuild, not tsup.

## Service Reuse via Path Alias

The extension imports CLI services through a `primer/*` path alias:

```typescript
// vscode-extension/src/services.ts — re-export layer
export { analyzeRepo } from "primer/services/analyzer.js";
```

This works because `tsconfig.json` maps `"primer/*": ["../src/*"]` and esbuild resolves it at bundle time. Never duplicate CLI service logic in the extension.

## Git Integration

- Use the built-in `vscode.git` extension API — **never import or bundle `simple-git`**.
- The extension declares `"extensionDependencies": ["vscode.git"]`.
- Types are vendored in `src/git.d.ts` from the upstream VS Code repo.
- `gitUtils.ts` finds the deepest matching repo for monorepo support.

## Command Pattern

Commands in `vscode-extension/src/commands/` are thin wrappers:

1. Call shared service from `services.ts`
2. Update tree providers / status bar
3. Show VS Code notifications for results

## Key Differences from CLI

| Aspect        | CLI           | Extension      |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Module format | ESM           | CommonJS       |
| Bundler       | tsup          | esbuild        |
| Git library   | simple-git    | vscode.git API |
| Output        | stdout/stderr | VS Code UI     |
